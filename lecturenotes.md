# W1 C1 - Dataset extraction 

download from datatopics.worldback.org/WDI_csv.zip
250 MB - lots of data. 

Step 1 is finding the right data to display the answer to the question. 
I argue  , however that the first step is to ask the right question. 

Step 2 : Data preprocessing : data cleaning 
lets look at organization of data. 
table of facts or measures across a dimension. 

Q. What is the current population of world and countries and how are they increasing . 

Understand the text file. 
load the data in tableau and then inspect it . 
remember -
we are extracting over here. 
reduce the amount of data for efficiency 
reduce to just one year , tableau can handle that easily. 

Usage of sum , count, bar graphs. 
usage of measured values 
usage of measured names 
usage of Pivots
usage of hide /unhide - to reduce ram comsumption 
usage of joins 
usage of data aggregations -quantizations ,count , binning - continous to discrete data. 
    - attribute makes sure that we are only taking one value 

Q plot the average population of each region. 
- I did it , but I still am getting a default bar plot rather than straightup numbers. Gotta look at it.
